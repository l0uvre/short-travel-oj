/***
Description:
Give you a directed graph G with n nodes and m edges. Please print the adjacency matrix A of G. Hints: adjacency matrix is a way to represent a graph. Suppose we have a directed graph G, if there is an edge from node i to node j in G, we have A[i][j] = 1 in Gâ€™s corresponding adjacency matrix A, otherwise, A[i][j] = 0.

Input:
The first line will be an integer T (1 <= T <= 50). T is the number of test case.

For each test case, the first line will be two integers n and m. ( 1 <= n <= 500, 0 <= m <= n*n)

Then there will be m lines. Each line will have two integers x y. x y means there is an edge from x to y. All nodes are labeled from 1 to n.


Output:
For each test case, print the adjacency matrix.

Input Example:
2
3 5
1 2
2 1
1 3
3 2
2 3
1 0

Output Example:
0 1 1
1 0 1
0 1 0
0
